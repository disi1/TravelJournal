# Re:Trip
Re:Trip is an Android mobile application which acts as a digital travel diary, complete with photos, text, and the necessary structure to plan your journey experiences.

> *Plan your trips, be present while experiencing novelty, and make sure that you spend some time writing and snapping photos of your adventures, to be able to recall them as memorable as they were the first time you made them.*

> *Let yourself be fully immersed in a new experience, while resting assured that you won’t miss out on anything, because the plan you made is a simple step-by-step travel guide. Did you enjoy that amazing ice cream? Take a picture and add a note about it. Pay attention, feel the smell and link its taste to that of previous experiences, maybe from childhood. Let’s just make sure your memories are there to stay, not to stray away.*

    ```
1. In Android Studio, open the project folder.
1. This project uses Places API, thus it needs and API Key. [Get an API Key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key) and add it to the local.properties like this:
```properties

```
5. Run the app using a virtual emulator or a physical device (min API level 21).
